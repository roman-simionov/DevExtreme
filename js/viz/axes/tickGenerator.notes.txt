TODO

minor ticks for log (make it denser)

showCalculatedTicks - deprecated in 15.2

remove _correctBusinessRange

stick

make option minorGridSpacingFactor


NOTES
gridSpacingFactor shoould be passed to tickGenerator, there is no default value
tickGenerator would not accept gridSpacingFactor <= 0
tickGenerator would not accept tickInterval <= 0

showCustomBoundaryTicks option in RangeSelector (and internal use in Polar chart) is passed tickManager as addMinMax and tickManager generates boundary ticks
This will not be included in tickGenerator and should be processed on Axis level

No margins
